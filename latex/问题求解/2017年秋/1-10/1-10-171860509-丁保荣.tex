\begin{problem}[UD:13.3]
Which of the following are functions? Give reasons for your answers.\\
(a) Define $\mathnormal{f}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ by $\mathnormal{f}$ =\{(x,y):x$^2$+y$^2$=4\}.\\
(b) Define $\mathnormal{f}$ :$\mathbb{R}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$ by $\mathnormal{f(x)=1/(x+1)}$.\\
(c) Define $\mathnormal{f}$ :$\mathbb{R}^2$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$ by $\mathnormal{f(x,y)=x+y}$.\\
(d) The domain of $\mathnormal{f}$ is the set of all closed intervals of real numbers of the form [a,b], where a,b$\in$$\mathbb{R}$, a$\le$b, and $\mathnormal{f}$ is defined by $\mathnormal{f([a,b])=a}$.\\
(e) Define $\mathnormal{f}$ : $\mathbb{N}$$\times$$\mathbb{N}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$ by $\mathnormal{f(n,m)=m}$.\\
(f) Define $\mathnormal{f}$ : $\mathbb{R}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$ by\\
\[f(x)= \begin{cases}
0 & if\quad x\ge 0\\
x & if\quad x\le 0
\end{cases}\]
(g) Define $\mathnormal{f}$ : $\mathbb{Q}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$ by\\
\[f(x)= \begin{cases}
x+1 & if\quad x\in 2\mathbb{N}\\
x-1 & if\quad x\in 3\mathbb{N}\\
2   & otherwise
\end{cases}\]
(h) The domain of $\mathnormal{f}$ is the set of all circles in the plane $\mathbb{N}^2$ and, if $\mathnormal{c}$ is such a circle, define $\mathnormal{f}$ by $\mathnormal{f(c)}$= the circumference of $\mathnormal{c}$.\\
(i) ($\emph{For students with a background in calculus.}$) The domain of $\mathnormal{f}$ is the set of all polynomials with real coefficients, and $\mathnormal{f}$ is defined by $\mathnormal{f(p)=p^{'}}$.(Here p$^{'}$ is the derivative of $\mathnormal{p}$.)\\
(j) ($\emph{For students with a background in calculus.}$) The domain of $\mathnormal{f}$ is the set of all polynomials and $\mathnormal{f}$ is defined by $\mathnormal{f(p)=\int_{0}^{1}p(x)dx.}$ (Here $\int_{0}^{1}p(x)dx$ is the definite integral of p.)

\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a) This is not a function, because it doesn't satisfy (i) or (ii). For example for x=0, y can be 2 or -2.\\
(b) This is not a function, because it doesn't satisfy (i), x=-1$\in$ dom($\mathnormal{f}$) but this x makes the expression meaningless, we cannot find a y related to it.\\
(c) This is a function, because it satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
(d) This is a function, because it satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
(e) This is a function, because it satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
(f) This is a function, because it satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
(g) This is not a function, because it doesn't satisfy (ii). For example, for x=6, we have y=7 or 5.\\
(h) This is a function, because it satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
(i) This is a function, because it satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
(j) This is a function, because it satisfies (i) and (ii)\\

\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[UD:13.4]
Let \(f:P(R) \rightarrow Z\) be defined by
\begin{align}
f(A) = 
\begin{cases}
min(A\bigcap N) \qquad if \quad A\bigcap N \neq \phi\\
-1              \qquad if \quad A\bigcap N = \phi
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Prove that f above is a well-defined function.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(i) for all A$\in$ $\mathbb{P(R)}$, whether A$\cap$ $\mathbb{N}$ = $\emptyset$ has two cases.\\
and the two cases are both defined in $\mathnormal{f}$\\
(ii) For every A that satisfies A$\cap$ $\mathbb{N}$ =$\emptyset$, y is unique, namely -1.\\
For every A that satisfies A$\cap$ $\mathbb{N}$ $\not=$ $\emptyset$, there is only one A$\cap$ $\mathbb{N}$, and the minmum of A$\cap$ $\mathbb{N}$ is unique , so y is unique.\\
$\therefore$ for every A$\in$ $\mathbb{P(R)}$, the y it relates to is unique.\\
$\therefore$ $\mathnormal{f}$ satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
$\therefore$ $\mathnormal{f}$ is a well-defined function. 
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[UD:13.5]
Let x be a nonempty set and let A be a subset of X. We define the Characteristic function of the set A by
\begin{align}
X_{A}(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1 \qquad if \quad x \in A\\
0 \qquad if \quad x \in X \backslash A
\end{cases}
\end{align}

(a)Since this is called the characteristic function, it probably is a function, but check this carefully anyway.

(b)Determine the domain and range of this function. Make sure you look at all possibilities for A and X.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The domain of is X, the range is \{0,1\}\\
(i) Since A is a subset of X, for every x$\in$X, there are two cases: x$\in$A or x$\in$X$\backslash$A\\
The two cases are defined in the $X_A$\\
(ii) Since A is a subset of X, for every x$\in$X, there are two cases: x$\in$A or x$\in$X$\backslash$A\\
(1) x$\in$A , the y is unique, namely 1\\
(2) x$\in$X$\backslash$A, the y is also unique, namely 0\\
$\therefore$ for every x$\in$X, the y it relates to is unique.\\
$\therefore$ $X_A$ satisfies (i) and (ii)\\
$\therefore$ $X_A$ is a well-defined function. 
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:13.11]
Suppose that f is a function from a set A to a set B. Thus, we know that f is a subset of \(A \times B\). Is the relation \(\{(y,x) : (x,y) \in f\}\) necessarily a function from B to A? Why or why not? (Say as much as is possible to say with the given information.)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
No,let us consider an example: $\mathnormal{f_1}$: (1,2) (2,2)\\
then according to the relation, we have $\mathnormal{f_2}$: (2,1) (2,2)\\
$\therefore$ for x=2, we have two y's: y=1 or y=2, it doesn't satisfy (ii)\\

\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:13.13]
Let X be a nonempty set. Find all relations on X that are both equivalence relations and functions.

\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:14.8]

\begin{align}
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
2 - x \qquad if \quad x < 1\\
1/x \qquad otherwise
\end{cases}
\end{align}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[UD:14.12]
Let a, b, c, and d be real numbers with \(a < b\) and \(c < d\). Define a bijection from the closed interval \([a,b]\) onto the closed interval \([c,d]\) and prove that your function is a bijection.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
f(x)=$\frac{d-c}{b-a}$(x-a) +c\\
Prove:\\
(1)if x1,x2$\in$[a,b] and f(x$_1$)=f(x$_2$), then $\frac{d-c}{b-a}$(x$_1$-a) +c=$\frac{d-c}{b-a}$(x$_2$-a) +c\\
$\therefore$ $\frac{d-c}{b-a}$(x$_1$-a)=$\frac{d-c}{b-a}$(x$_2$-a) \\
$\because$ a<b and c<d\\
$\therefore$ a-b<0, c-d<0\\
$\therefore$ x$_1$-a=x$_2$-a\\
$\therefore$ x$_1$=x$_2$\\
$\therefore$ this function is one-to-one\\
(2)$\because$ the range of x is [a,b]\\
$\therefore$ the range of (x-a) is [0,b-a]\\
$\therefore$ the range of $\frac{x-a}{b-a}$ is [0,1]\\
$\therefore$ the range of $\frac{d-c}{b-a}$(x-a) is [0,d-c]\\
$\therefore$ the range of $\frac{d-c}{b-a}$(x-a) +c is [c,d]\\
$\therefore$ this function is onto.\\
Based on (1) and (2), this function is bijective.\\
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:14.13]
Let \(F([0,1])\) denote the set of all real-valued functions defined on the closed interval \([0,1]\). Define a new function \(\phi:F([0,1]) \rightarrow R\) by \(\phi(f) = f(0)\). Is \(\phi\) a function from \(F([0,1])\) to R? Is it one-to-one? Is it onto? Remember to prove all claims, and to provide examples where appropriate.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(1) $\phi$ is a function from F([0,1]) to R. For every f defined on [0,1], we can have a unique f(0), thus a unique $\phi$(f),and f(0)$\in$R. $\therefore$ $\phi$ is a function from F([0,1]) to R.\\
(2) it is not one-to-one. for $\phi$$\mathnormal{f}$=f(0). we can have f(x)=x+f(0) or f(x)=2x+f(0) and so on\\
(3) it is onto, for every f(0)$\in$R, we can let f(x)=x+f(0) $\in$ F([0,1])\\
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:14.15]
Let f be a function, \(f:R \rightarrow R\). Define a new function \(f\cdot f\) by 
\[(f\cdot f)(x) = f(x) \cdot f(x).\]
Prove that \(f \cdot f\) is a function. Then do the remaining parts of the problem. (You may wish to work Problem 14.14, if you havem't already done so.)

(a) Does there exists a function f for which \(f\cdot f\) is one-to-one? If not, why not? If there is, what is an example?

(b) Does there exist a function f for which \(f\cdot f\) maps onto R? If not, what is \(ran(f\cdot f)\)? Your answer will be terms of \(ran(f)\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(i) $\because$ f(x) is a function\\
$\therefore$ for every x$\in$ R, there is a f(x)$\in$R that it relates to.\\
$\therefore$ for every x$\in$ R, there is a f(x)*f(x)$\in$R that it relates to.\\
(ii) $\because$ f(x) is a function\\
$\therefore$ for every x$\in$ R, there is an unique f(x)$\in$R that it relates to.\\
$\therefore$ for every x$\in$ R, there is an unique f(x)*f(x)$\in$R that it relates to.\\
Based on (i) and (ii), we have (f·f)(x) is a function\\
(a) Yes, let f(x)=2$^x$\\
(b)No, there doesn't exist a function f for which f·f maps onto R\\
(1) if ran(f)=(a,b) where a$\le$0$\le$b, then ran(f·f)=[0,(max(|a|,|b|))$_2$). (for ran(f)=[a,b] or (a,b] or [a,b) is the similar)\\
(2) if ran(f)=(a,b) where a<b<0 or b>a>0, then ran(f·f)=( (min(|a|,|b|))$^2$. (max(|a|,|b|))$^2$) (for ran(f)=[a,b] or (a,b] or [a,b) is the similar)\\
(3) if ran(f)=(a,+$\infty$),where a$\ge$0, then ran(f·f)=(a$^2$,+$\infty$), (for ran(f)=[a,+$\infty$) is the similar)\\
(4) if ran(f)=(a,+$\infty$),where a<0, then ran(f·f)=[0,+$\infty$). (for ran(f)=[a,+$\infty$) is the similar)\\
(5) if ran(f)=(-$\infty$,b),where b$\ge$0, then ran(f·f)=[0,+$\infty$). (for ran(f)=(-$\infty$,b] is the similar)\\
(6) if ran(f)=(-$\infty$,b),where b<0, then ran(f·f)=(b$_2$,+$\infty$). (for ran(f)=(-$\infty$,b] is the similar)\\
\end{solution}

(a) \(f(x) = 1/(1+x), g(x) = x^{2}\);

(b) \(f(x) = x^{2}, G(X) = \sqrt{x}\) (simplify this one);

(c) \(f(x) = 1/x, g(x) = x^{2} + 1\);

(d) \(f(x) = |x|,g(x) = f(x)\).
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
f$\circ$g=f(g(x))=f(x$^2$)=$\frac{1}{1+x^2}$  dom(f$\circ$g)=R ran(f$\circ$g)=(0,1]\\
g$\circ$f=g(f(x))=g($\frac{1}{1+x}$)=$\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}$  dom(g$\circ$f)=R$\backslash$\{-1\}  ran(g$\circ$f)=(0,+$\infty$)\\
(b)\\
f$\circ$g=f(g(x))=f($\sqrt{x}$)=x  dom(f$\circ$g)=[0,+$\infty$) ran(f$\circ$g)=[0,+$\infty$)\\
g$\circ$f=g(f(x))=g(x$^2$)=|x| dom(g$\circ$f)=R  ran(g$\circ$f)=[0,+$\infty$)\\

\begin{problem}[UD:15.6]
The functions \(f:R \backslash \{-2\} \rightarrow R \backslash \{1\}\) and \(g:R \backslash \{1\} \rightarrow R \backslash \{-2\}\) defined by 
\[f(x) = \frac{x-3}{x+2} \quad and \quad g(x) = \frac{3+2x}{1-x}\]
are well-defined functions (you need not check this).

(a) Calculate \(f \circ g\) and \(g \circ f\).

(b) What can you conclude about f and g from your result in part (a)? If you use a theorem, give a reference.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
f$\circ$g=f(g(x))=f($\frac{3+2x}{1-x}$)=$\frac{\frac{3+2x}{1-x}-3}{\frac{3+2x}{1-x}+2}$=$\frac{3+2x-3(1-x)}{3+2x+2(1-x)}$=$\frac{5x}{5}$=x\\
g$\circ$f=g(f(x))=g($\frac{x-3}{x+2}$)=$\frac{3+\frac{2(x-3)}{x+2}}{1-\frac{x-3}{x+2}}$=$\frac{3(x+2)+2x-3}{x+2-(x-3)}$=$\frac{5x}{5}$=x\\
(b)\\let A=R$\backslash$\{-2\} B=R$\backslash$\{1\}\\
And according to (a) we have f$\circ$g=i$_B$ and g$\circ$f=i$_A$\\
$\therefore$ according to Theorem 15.8, we have g=f$^{-1}$.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:15.7]
(a)If possible, find examples of functions \(f:A \rightarrow B\) and \(g:B \rightarrow A\) such that \(f \circ g = i_{b}\) when:

(i) \(A = \{1,2,3\}, B = \{4,5\}\);

(ii) \(A = \{1,2\}, B = \{4,5\}\);

(iii) \(A = \{1,2,3\}, B = \{4,5,6,7\}\).\\
Draw diagrams of A and B in each case above.\\
(b) Give an example pf sets A and B, and functions \(f:A \rightarrow B\) and \(g:B \rightarrow A\) such that \(f \circ g = i_{B}\), but \(g \circ f \neq i_{A}\). (Thus the existence of a function g such that \(f \circ g = i_{B}\) is not enough to conclude that f has an inverse!) Why doesn't this contradict Theorem 15.4, part(iv)?\\
(c) Give an example of sets A and B, anf functions \(f:A \rightarrow B\) and \(g:B \rightarrow A\) such that \(g \circ f = i_{A}\), but \(f \circ g \neq i_{B}\). (Thus the existence of a function g such that \(g \circ f = i_{A}\) is not enough to conclude that f has an inverse!) Why doesn't this contradict Theorem 15.4, part(iv)?\\
(d) Let A and B be two sets, and let \(f: A \rightarrow B\) be a function. Assume further that there exists a function \(g:B \rightarrow A\) such that \(f \circ g = i_{B}\). Must f be one-to-one? onto?\\
(e) Looking over your work above, what should be your strategy in solving a question like (d) above? Whatever you decide, use it to solve the following: Let f and g be as above and suppose \(g \circ f = i_{A}\). Must f be one-to-one? onto?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
(i) let:
\[f(x)= \begin{cases}
4 & if\quad x= 1\\
x+2 & if\quad x=2,3
\end{cases}\]
g(x)=x-2\\
(ii) let f(x)=x+3 and g(x)=x-3\\
(iii) this is not possible\\

A=\{1,2,3\},B=\{4,5\}
 let:
\[f(x)= \begin{cases}
4 & if\quad x= 1\\
x+2 & if\quad x=2,3
\end{cases}\]
g(x)=x-2\\
This doesn't contradict Theorem 15.4,part(iv) beacuse f here cannot be a bijective function.\\
(c)\\
A=\{4,5\},B=\{1,2,3\}
 let:
\[g(x)= \begin{cases}
4 & if\quad x= 1\\
x+2 & if\quad x=2,3

This doesn't contradict Theorem 15.4,part(iv) beacuse g here cannot be a bijective function.\\
(d)\\
A=\{1,2,3\},B=\{4,5\}
 let:
\[f(x)= \begin{cases}
4 & if\quad x= 1\\
x+2 & if\quad x=2,3
\end{cases}\]
g(x)=x-2\\
As we cans see, f doesn't need to be one-to-one but it has to be onto.\\
(e)\\
f must be one-to-one but it doesn't have to be onto.

\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:15.11]
Suppose that \(f:A \rightarrow B\) and \(g_{1}\) and \(g_{2}\) are functions from B to A such that \(f \circ g_{1} = f \circ g_{2}\). Show that if f is bijective, then \(g_{1} = g_{2}\). If \(g_{1} \circ f = g_{2} \circ f\) and f is bijective, must \(g_{1} = g_{2}\)?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
$\because$ f is bijective\\
$\therefore$ we have f$^{-1}$\\
$\therefore$ f$^{-1}$$\circ$f$\circ$$g_1$=f$^{-1}$$\circ$f$\circ$$g_2$\\
$\therefore$ i$_A$$\circ$$g_1$=i$_A$$\circ$$g_2$\\
$\because$ i$_A$$\circ$$g_1$=$g_1$ and i$_A$$\circ$$g_2$=$g_2$\\
$\therefore$ $g_1$=$g_2$\\
(b)\\
$\because$ f is bijective\\
$\therefore$ we have f$^{-1}$\\
$\therefore$ $g_1$$\circ$f$\circ$f$^{-1}$=$g_2$$\circ$f$\circ$f$^{-1}$\\
$\therefore$ $g_1$$\circ$i$_B$=$g_2$$\circ$i$_B$\\
$\because$ $g_1$$\circ$i$_B$=$g_1$ and $g_2$$\circ$i$_B$=$g_2$\\
$\therefore$ $g_1$=$g_2$\\
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[UD:15.12]
Let \(f:A \rightarrow A\) be a function. Define a relation on A by \(a \sim b\) if and only if \(f(a) = f(b)\). Is this an equivalence? If f is one-to-one, what is the equivalence class of a point \(a \in A\)?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
Yes, this is an equivalence.\\
E$_a$=\{a\}\\

\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:15.13]
Let \(f:A \rightarrow A\) be a function. Define a relation on A by \(a \sim b\) if and only if \(f(a) = b\). Is this an equivalence relation for an arbitrary function f? If not, is there a function for which it is an equivalence relation?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
No. An example: f(x)=x-1 doesn't satisify the symmetric\\
Yes, f(x)=x\\
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:15.14]
Let A, B, C, and D be nonempty sets. Let \(f:A \rightarrow B\) and \(g:C \rightarrow D\) be functions.

(a) Prove that if f and g are one-to-one, then \(H: A \times C \rightarrow B \times D\) defined by 
\[H(a,b) = (f(a),g(c))\]
is a one-to-one function. (Check that it is one-to-one and a function.)

(b) Prove that if f and g are onto, then H is also onto.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
$\because$ f and g are one-to-one functions, \\
$\therefore$ for every a$\in$A and c$\in$C, we have there exist a u$\in$B that satisfies u=f(a) and a w$\in$B that satisfies w=g(c).\\
and for every u$\in$ran(f) and every w$\in$ ran(g), we have there exist a unique a$\in$A that satisfies u=f(a) and a unique c$\in$C that satisfies w=g(c).\\

(b)\\
$\because$ f and g are onto functions, \\
$\therefore$ for every a$\in$A and c$\in$C, we have there exist a u$\in$B that satisfies u=f(a) and a w$\in$B that satisfies w=g(c).\\
and for every u$\in$B and w$\in$D, we have there exist a  u$\in$A that satisfies u=f(a) and a w$\in$B that satisfies w=g(c).\\

\begin{problem}[UD:15.15]
Let A, B, C, and D be nonempty sets. Let \(f:A \rightarrow B\) and \(g:C \rightarrow D\) be functions. Consider H defined on \(A \bigcup C\) by 
\begin{align}
H(x)= 
\begin{cases}
f(x) \qquad if \quad x \in A\\
g(x) \qquad if \quad x \in C
\end{cases}
\end{align}

Show that there exist sets A, B, C, and D for which H is not a function, But there also exist such sets for which H is a function. What conditions can we place on A and C that assume us that H is a function?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a) Let A=\{1,2,3\} B=\{3,4,5\} C=\{0\} D=\{1\} this H is not a function\\
 Let A=\{1,2\} B=\{3,4\} C=\{0\} D=\{1\} this H is a function\\
(b) for x$\in$A$\cap$C, we let f(x)=g(x)
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[UD:15.20]
In this problem, we look at a function called the restriction function, which we now define.

If \(f:A \rightarrow B\) is a function, and \(A_{1} \subset A\), we define another function \(F:A_{1} \rightarrow B\) by \(F(a) = f(a)\) for all \(a \in A_{1}\). This function F is called the restriction of f to \(A_{1}\) and is usually denoted \(f|_{A_{1}}\), We now turn to the problem:

(a) Prove that if f is one-to-one, then \(f|_{A_{1}}\) is one-to-one.

(b) Prove that if \(f|_{A_{1}}\) is onto, the f is onto.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
$\because$ we have A$_1$$\Subset$A\\
$\therefore$ we can easily note that ran(f|$_{A1}$)$\subseteq$ran(f)\\
$\because$ f is one-to-one\\
$\therefore$ for every y$\in$ran(f), we have there exists a unique x that satisfies y=f(x)\\
$\because$ ran(f|$_{A1}$)$\subseteq$ran(f)\\
$\therefore$ for every y$\in$ran(f|$_{A1}$), we have there exists a unique x that satisfies y=f(x)\\
$\therefore$ f|$_{A1}$ is one-to-one.\\
(b)\\
$\because$ f|$_{A1}$ is one-to-one.\\
$\therefore$ ran(f|$_{A1}$)=B\\
$\because$ we have A$_1$$\Subset$A\\
$\therefore$ we can easily note that ran(f|$_{A1}$)$\subseteq$ran(f)\\
$\therefore$ we have B$\subseteq$ran(f)\\
$\because$ ran(f)$\subseteq$B\\
$\therefore$ we have ran(f)=B\\
$\therefore$ f is onto
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[UD:16.19]
Let \(f:A \rightarrow B\) be a function. Prove that if f is onto, then \(\{f^{-1}(\{b\}): b \in B\}\) partitions the set A.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
Let I$_b$=\{f$^{-1}$(\{b\}):b$\in$ B\}\\
$\because$ f is a function\\
$\therefore$ for every y$_1$ and y$_2$ $\in$B, if f(x)=y$_1$ and f(x)=y$_2$, we have y$_1$=y$_2$\\
$\therefore$ I$_{y_1}$ $\cap$ I$_{y_2}$=$\emptyset$ for every y$_1$ and y$_2$ $\in$B\\
$\bigcup _{b\in B}$I$_b$=$\bigcup_{b\in B}$f$^{-1}$(\{b\})=f$^{-1}$($\bigcup _{b\in B}$\{b\})=f$^{-1}$(B)=A\\
$\therefore$ \{f$^{-1}$(\{b\}):b$\in$ B\} partitions the set A.\\
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:16.20]
Suppose that \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) is a function, and let \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\) be subsets of X.

(a) If \(f(A_{1}) = f(A_{2})\), must \(A_{1} = A_{2}\)?

(b) Let f be a bijective function. Show that if \(f(A_{1}) = f(A_{2})\), then \(A_{1} = A_{2}\). Indicate clearly where you use one-to-one or onto. Did you use both?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a) it doesn't need to\\
(b) \\
$\because$ f(A$_1$)=f(A$_2$)\\
$\therefore$ \{f(a):a$\in$A$_1$\}=\{f(b):b$\in$A$_2$\}\\
Let S=\{f(a):a$\in$A$_1$\} T=\{f(b):b$\in$A$_2$\}\\
$\therefore$ S $\subseteq$ T and T$\subseteq$S\\
(i)S $\subseteq$ T:\\
$\therefore$ for every s$\in$S ,we have s$\in$T\\
$\therefore$ for every f(a)$\in$S, we have f(c)$\in$T that satisfies f(c)=f(a)\\
$\because$ f is one-to-one\\
$\therefore$ if f(a)=f(c), then a=c\\
$\therefore$ for every a$\in$A$_1$, we have a $\in$A$_2$\\
$\therefore$ A$_1$ $\subseteq$ A$_2$\\
(ii)T$\subseteq$S:\\
Similarly, we have A$_2$ $\subseteq$ A$_1$\\
$\therefore$ A$_1$=A$_2$\\
And I only use one-to-one.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:16.21]
Suppose that \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) is a function, and let \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\) be subsets of Y.

(a) If \(f^{-1}(B_{1}) = f^{-1}(B_{2})\), must \(B_{1} = B_{2}\)?

(b) Let f be a bijective function. Show that if \(f^{-1}(B_{1}) = f^{-1}(B_{2})\), then \(B_{1} = B_{2}\). Indicate clearly where you use one-to-one or onto. Did you use both?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a) No,cause Y is not neccessarily the range.\\
(b)\\
$\because$ f is bijective\\
$\therefore$ f$^{-1}$ is bijective\\
$\therefore$ according to 16.20(b), we have B$_1$=B$_2$
And I use both one-to-one and onto.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}[UD:16.22]
Let X be a nonempty set and let \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\) be subsets of X. Recall the notation for characteristic function, \(x_{A}\), defined in Problem 13.5. 

(a) If \(X_{A_{1}} = X_{A_{2}}\), must \(A_{1} = A_{2}\)?

(b) Show that the product \(X_{A_{1}} \cdot X_{A_{2}}\), which is defined pointwise on X by \((X_{A_{1}} \cdot X_{A_{2}})(x) = X_{A_{1}}(x) \cdot X_{A_{2}}(x)\), satisfies \(X_{A_{1}} \cdot X_{A_{2}} = X_{A_{1} \bigcap A_{2}}\).

(c) Show that \(X_{A_{1}}(x) + X_{A_{2}}(x) - X_{A_{1} \bigcap A_{2}} = X_{A_{1} \bigcup A_{2}}\). (In other words, for each \(x \in X\), we have \(X_{A_{1}}(x) + X_{A_{2}}(x) - X_{A_{1} \bigcap A_{2}} = X_{A_{1} \bigcup A_{2}}\).)

(d) Can you find a similar result for \(X_{X \backslash A_{1}}\)?

\begin{solution}
(a) Yes.\\
(b)\\
