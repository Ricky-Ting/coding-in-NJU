\begin{problem}[DH:2.1]	% NOTE: use '[]' (instead of '()' or '{}') to provide additional information
   The algorithm for summing the salaries of N employees presented in the text performs a loop that consists of adding one salary to the total and advancing a pointer on the employee list N-1 times.The last salary is added separately. What is the reason for this? Why don't we perform the loop N times? 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Because if we perform the loop N times, when the machine performs the N$^{th}$ time, first we add the N$^{th}$ employee's salary to the total, and then we point to the next of the N$^{th}$ employee, namely the (N+1)$^{th}$ employee.\\
  So here comes the problem.\\
  The pointer excceeds the limitation of the number of the employees.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[DH:2.2]
  Consider the bubblesort algorithm presented in the text.\\
  (a) Explain why the outer loop is performed only N-1 times.\\
  (b) Improve the algorithm so that on every repeated execution of the outer loop,the inner loop checks one element less.\\
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  (a) After each outer loop,it places the largest number of the remaining unordered numbers at the beginning of the ordered numbers.\\
      So when the last N-1 numbers are settled, the second number must be larger than the first number.\\
      So there is no need to perform the N$^{th}$ loop to settle the first number.\\
  (b) \\
\begin{verbatim}
      (1)set i=0;
      (2)do the following N-1 times:
          (2.1) point to the first element;
          (2.2) do the following (N-1-i) times:
                (2.2.1) compare the element pointed to with the next element;
                (2.2.2) if the compared elements are in the wrong order, exchange them;
                (2.2.3) point to the next element;

\begin{problem}[DH: 2.7]
The factorial of a non-negative integer N is the product of all positive integers smaller than or equal to N. More formally, the expression N factorial, denoted by N!, is recursively defined by \(0! = 1\) and \((N + 1)! = N! × (N + 1)\). For example, \(1! = 1\) and \(4! = 3! × 4 = . . . = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24\).\\

Write algorithms that compute \(N!\), given a non-negative integer \(N\).\\
